# Intelligent Game Designer
This is a repository for the group project of team Juliet. It aims to automate the process of level design for a game similar to Candy Crush Saga.

## Branching
### What To Do
Unless you are providing a simple fix to the project, please develop all code on a branch (see below), and then only 
merge that branch to `master` once you are *sure* it works.
### Branch Names
The branching convention we will use is as follows:
`packagename-yourname`

For example, if I (Devan) am making changes to the `coregame` package, then I will make them on a branch entitled 
`coregame-devan`. In certain circumstances, if you are working on a package which you know that no one else will be 
working on (e.g. Ben working on the `userinterface` package) then you can leave the `-yourname` part out of the 
branch name.
